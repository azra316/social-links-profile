## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project helped me practice:

- Using **CSS custom properties** to create a consistent design system with variables like colors and spacing.
- Implementing **responsive layouts** using media queries.
- Enhancing user experience by adding **hover states** and **focus states** to buttons and links.
- Styling buttons and links with interactive behaviors (e.g., `cursor: pointer` and hover color transitions).
